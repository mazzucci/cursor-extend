# Saved Commands (cursor-extend)

This project has saved commands in .cursor/commands.json.

When the user asks about running, building, testing, deploying, or executing commands,
check the saved commands first by reading .cursor/commands.json.

**Usage:**
- User says "run tests" → Check commands.json for a test command
- User says "deploy to staging" → Check commands.json for deploy command
- Show available commands when asked

Saved commands make the team faster - no need to remember complex commands!
